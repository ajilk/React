# React
A simple game that tests your reaction speed

### How to Play
`make` then run it with `./react` <br/>
Once you are in the game, you will be greeted with the main page
which will display different modes. After you have selected a mode 
with its letter assigned, the game will start. You can click Q to quit
to the main menu and one more time quit the application
